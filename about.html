<p>Russia, or the Russian Federation, is a country spanning Eastern Europe and North Asia.<br >
     It is the largest country in the world by area, extending across eleven time zones. <br >
     It shares land boundaries with fourteen countries.<br >
     It is the world's ninth-most populous country and Europe's most populous country. 
     The country's capital as well as its largest city is Moscow. Saint Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city <br >
     and cultural capital. Other major urban areas in the country include Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, <br >
     Nizhny Novgorod, Chelyabinsk, Krasnoyarsk, Kazan, Krasnodar and Rostov-on-Don.<br >
    <hr >
    The East Slavs emerged as a recognised group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries CE. <br >
    The first East Slavic state, Kievan Rus', arose in the 9th century, and in 988, <br >
    it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire. Rus' ultimately disintegrated, <br >
    with the Grand Duchy of Moscow growing to become the Tsardom of Russia. By the early 18th century,<br > 
    Russia had vastly expanded through conquest, annexation, and the efforts of Russian explorers, developing<br > 
    into the Russian Empire, which remains the third-largest empire in history. However, with the Russian Revolution<br >
    in 1917, Russia's monarchic rule was abolished and eventually replaced by the Russian SFSRâ€”the <br >
    world's first constitutionally socialist state. Following the Russian Civil War, <br >
    the Russian SFSR established the Soviet Union with three other Soviet republics, within which<br > 
    it was the largest and principal constituent. At the expense of millions of lives, <br >
    the Soviet Union underwent rapid industrialisation in the 1930s and later played a decisive<br > 
    role for the Allies in World War II by leading large-scale efforts on the Eastern Front. With the<br > 
    onset of the Cold War, it competed with the United States for global ideological influence. <br >
    The Soviet era of the 20th century saw some of the most significant Russian technological achievements,<br > 
    including the first human-made satellite and the first human expedition into outer space.</p>
