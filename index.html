<h2>The begining :</h2>
<p>
    The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was dissolved on 26 December 1991 by 
    Declaration № 142-Н of the Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, 
    formally establishing the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a sovereign state and subject 
    of international law.[1] It also brought an end to the Soviet Union's federal government 
    and General Secretary (also President) Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to reform the Soviet 
    political and economic system in an attempt to stop a period of political stalemate and 
    economic backslide. The Soviet Union had experienced internal stagnation and 
    ethnic separatism. Although highly centralized until its final years, the country 
    was made up of 15 top-level republics that served as homelands for different ethnicities. 
    By late 1991, amid a catastrophic political crisis, with several republics already departing 
    the Union and the waning of centralized power, the leaders of three of its founding members, 
    the Russian, Belorussian, and Ukrainian SSRs, declared that the Soviet Union 
    no longer existed. Eight more republics joined their declaration shortly thereafter. 
    Gorbachev resigned on 25 December 1991 and what was left of the Soviet parliament voted 
    to end itself.

<h2>The fallout</h2>
<p>The people from the internal states of the USSR<br />
    started protesting for independance.<br /> Also the tesions were 
    all time high the german capital Berlin</p>
    The fall of the Berlin Wall German: Mauerfall, on November 9, 1989, 
    during the Peaceful Revolution, marked the destruction of the Berlin Wall 
    and the figurative Iron Curtain. It was one of the series of events that 
    started the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, preceded by the 
    Solidarity Movement in Poland. The fall of the inner German border took place 
    shortly afterward. An end to the Cold War was declared at the Malta Summit three 
    weeks later and the German reunification took place in October the following year.

<h2>The protests</h2>
<p>
    At the end of the 1980s, protest movements across the Soviet Union sprung up, 
    with people in the constituent republics calling for independence. Fed up with 
    the broken, corrupt Soviet regime and fueled by burgeoning nationalism, protesters
     demanded an end to Soviet rule and a new, more equitable society.
    <hr >
    Some of the protests were tolerated; others were brutally put down. After the failure 
    of the August 1991 coup, where communist hard-liners attempted to seize power, the dominos
    continued to fall and the Soviet Union officially broke up later that year -- putting 15
    independent countries on the map.
